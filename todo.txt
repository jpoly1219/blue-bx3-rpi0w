TODO:

Sensors to integrate:
- temperature
- humidity
- accelerometer
- test with mock data first

MOSFET control
- GPIO, 3.3V
- current calculation

Redundancy Script
- Overcuring is fine
- the LED should be constantly on, worst case scenario

MAYBE:

FPGA
- pi has a limited # of pins
- code will be painful to read and maintain if sensors connect
    directly to the pi
- fine control over LEDs
- temperature sensor array for possible heatmap
